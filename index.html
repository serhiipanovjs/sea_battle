        <h2>Sea Battle Game Rules</h2>
        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <!-- Description of the grid size -->
        <h4>Grid Size: The game is played on a 13x13 grid.</h4>
        <!-- List of ships each player has -->
        <h4>Ships: Each player has the following ships:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>One Aircraft Carrier (length 5)</li>
            <li>Two Battleships (length 4)</li>
            <li>Three Cruisers (length 3)</li>
            <li>Four Destroyers (length 2)</li>
            <li>Five Submarines (length 1)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ship Placement:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically on the grid.</li>
            <li>Ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally.</li>
            <li>Ships must be placed entirely within the grid boundaries.</li>
            <li>There must be at least one cell space between ships (no touching even diagonally).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <h4>Shooting:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the shot hits a ship, the system automatically announces "hit" and marks it on grids.</li>
            <li>If the shot misses, the system announces "miss" and marks it on grids.</li>
            <li>Hits and misses are recorded and displayed on the playerâ€™s tracking grid.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sinking Ships:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When all cells of a ship are hit, the system announces the type of ship that was sunk.</li>
            <li>The system keeps track of the remaining ships for each player.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Winning the Game:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The game continues until one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships.</li>
            <li>The player who sinks all of their opponent's ships first wins the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
