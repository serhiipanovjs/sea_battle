            <li>If the shot misses, the system announces "miss" and marks it on grids.</li>
            <li>Hits and misses are recorded and displayed on the playerâ€™s tracking grid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sinking Ships:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>When all cells of a ship are hit, the system announces the type of ship that was sunk.</li>
            <li>The system keeps track of the remaining ships for each player.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Winning the Game:</h4>
